# üìò **Day 2: JOINs, Aggregate Functions & Subqueries in PostgreSQL**

---

## üéØ **Goal**:

* Understand how to link tables with JOINs
* Use aggregate functions to summarize data
* Use subqueries to write complex conditions

---

## üîß Prerequisite Tables

We'll use these sample tables today:

```sql
-- Table 1: departments
CREATE TABLE departments (
    dept_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    dept_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

-- Table 2: employees (already created yesterday, adding FK now)
ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN dept_id INT;
ALTER TABLE employees ADD CONSTRAINT fk_dept FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES departments(dept_id);
```

### ‚úÖ Sample Data

```sql
-- Insert into departments
INSERT INTO departments (dept_name) VALUES 
('Engineering'), 
('Sales'), 
('HR'), 
('Marketing'), 
('Finance');

-- Update employees to assign dept_id
UPDATE employees SET dept_id = 1 WHERE dept = 'Engineering';
UPDATE employees SET dept_id = 2 WHERE dept = 'Sales';
UPDATE employees SET dept_id = 3 WHERE dept = 'HR';
UPDATE employees SET dept_id = 4 WHERE dept = 'Marketing';
UPDATE employees SET dept_id = 5 WHERE dept = 'Finance';
```

---

## ‚úÖ Section 1: JOINS

### üî∏ `INNER JOIN`: Match records in both tables

```sql
SELECT e.emp_id, e.fname, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
```

### üî∏ `LEFT JOIN`: Get all employees, even if no matching department

```sql
SELECT e.emp_id, e.fname, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
```

### üî∏ `RIGHT JOIN`: Get all departments, even if no employees

```sql
SELECT e.fname, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
RIGHT JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
```

### üî∏ `FULL JOIN`: Everything from both sides

```sql
SELECT e.fname, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
FULL JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
```

---

## ‚úÖ Section 2: Aggregate Functions

### üî∏ COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN

```sql
-- Count total employees
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;

-- Average salary
SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees;

-- Maximum salary in Engineering
SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees WHERE dept = 'Engineering';

-- Salary stats per department
SELECT dept, COUNT(*) AS emp_count, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY dept;
```

---

## ‚úÖ Section 3: GROUP BY & HAVING

### üî∏ Group + Filter aggregate results

```sql
-- Total salary per department
SELECT dept, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY dept;

-- Only departments where total salary > 100000
SELECT dept, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY dept
HAVING SUM(salary) > 100000;
```

---

## ‚úÖ Section 4: Subqueries

### üî∏ Subquery in `WHERE` clause

```sql
-- Employees with salary > average salary
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```

### üî∏ Subquery in `FROM` clause (Derived Table)

```sql
SELECT dept, avg_salary
FROM (
  SELECT dept, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
  FROM employees
  GROUP BY dept
) AS dept_avg
WHERE avg_salary > 50000;
```

### üî∏ Subquery in `SELECT` clause

```sql
SELECT fname, lname,
  (SELECT dept_name FROM departments d WHERE d.dept_id = e.dept_id) AS department
FROM employees e;
```

---

## üß™ Practice Task for Today

> **Task:** Write and test these queries:

1. Get employee names and their department names (using JOIN)
2. Find employees who joined in the last 6 months
3. Find departments with more than 2 employees
4. Show department-wise max salary
5. Show employees whose salary is more than the average salary
6. Show employees who work in a department that has "Sales" in its name (using JOIN + LIKE)

---

Great progression, Dipak! Now that you‚Äôve learned views, let's move on to **Stored Procedures** ‚Äî a powerful feature in SQL, especially useful in enterprise applications and backend systems (like Spring Boot + PostgreSQL apps) for **encapsulating logic in the database itself**.

---

# üìò **Stored Procedure in PostgreSQL ‚Äì Complete Guide with StoreDB Example**

---

## üîç What is a Stored Procedure?

A **Stored Procedure** is a precompiled set of SQL statements stored in the database. It can:

* Perform logic (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.)
* Accept input/output parameters
* Be reused across apps
* Reduce network roundtrips
* Improve performance for complex operations

> üîÅ Think of it like a **function/method inside the database**.

---

## ‚úÖ Basic Syntax (PostgreSQL)

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE procedure_name(param1 type, param2 type)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
  -- SQL statements go here
END;
$$;
```

To **call** a procedure:

```sql
CALL procedure_name(arg1, arg2);
```

---

## üßæ Example 1: Insert a New Customer (Simple Insert)

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE add_customer(
  cname VARCHAR,
  ccity VARCHAR
)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO customers (name, city)
  VALUES (cname, ccity);
END;
$$;
```

### üß™ Call it:

```sql
CALL add_customer('Rohit', 'Ahmedabad');
```

---

## üîÅ Example 2: Update Customer City (With Logging Logic)

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE update_customer_city(
  cid INT,
  new_city VARCHAR
)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
  UPDATE customers
  SET city = new_city
  WHERE customer_id = cid;

  RAISE NOTICE 'Customer city updated successfully!';
END;
$$;
```

### üß™ Call it:

```sql
CALL update_customer_city(1, 'Bangalore');
```

---

## üîÅ Example 3: Increase Salary of Employees in a Department

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE increase_salary_by_dept(
  deptname VARCHAR,
  increment DECIMAL
)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
  UPDATE employees
  SET salary = salary + increment
  WHERE dept = deptname;

  RAISE NOTICE 'Salaries updated in department %', deptname;
END;
$$;
```

### üß™ Call it:

```sql
CALL increase_salary_by_dept('Sales', 2000);
```

---

## üí° Example 4: With Transaction Handling

You can add `BEGIN ... EXCEPTION ... END` blocks inside procedures.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE safe_order_delete(orderId INT)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
  DELETE FROM order_items WHERE order_id = orderId;
  DELETE FROM orders WHERE order_id = orderId;

  RAISE NOTICE 'Order and its items deleted';
EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN
  RAISE NOTICE 'Something went wrong';
END;
$$;
```

---

## ‚úÖ Managing Procedures

| Task    | Command                                 |
| ------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Create  | `CREATE PROCEDURE`                      |
| Replace | `CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE`           |
| Call    | `CALL proc_name(args);`                 |
| List    | `\df` in `psql`, or query `pg_proc`     |
| Drop    | `DROP PROCEDURE proc_name(args_types);` |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è You must specify parameter types to drop:

```sql
DROP PROCEDURE update_customer_city(INT, VARCHAR);
```

---

## üöÄ Real-World Use Cases (Spring Boot Perspective)

| Use Case                 | Why Use Stored Procedure?                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Complex batch updates    | Efficient than multiple API calls        |
| Custom reporting         | Speed up queries for dashboards          |
| Auditing, logs, triggers | Embed logic in DB itself                 |
| Sensitive business logic | Keep critical logic inside DB (security) |

> In Spring Boot, you can call them via:

* JPA `@Procedure`
* JDBC template
* Native SQL query

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Feature           | Benefit                     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| Precompiled SQL   | Faster execution            |
| Logic in DB       | Reduces app-side complexity |
| Can accept args   | Like a function or method   |
| Secure & reusable | Business rules stay in DB   |

---

## üß™ Practice Tasks

1. Create a procedure to delete a customer and all their orders
